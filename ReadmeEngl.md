## Project Description
data analytics based on the 400 best-selling video games between 1977 and 2020 comparing sales, reviews and audiences. The aim is to identify the years with the greatest impact on the video game market.

## Task List
  
1. The ten best-selling video games
2. Missing review scores
3. Years that video game critics loved
4. Was 1982 really that great?
5. Years that dropped off the critics' favorites list
6. Years video game players loved
7. Years that both players and critics loved
8. Sales in the best video game years

## Conclusions

The "When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games" project on the DataCamp platform aims to consolidate the knowledge acquired in the data manipulation modules and to put into practice what I have learned, such as table joins, set theory, filtering, grouping and sorting data. Working on the project allowed me to solidify my knowledge of SQL queries, present the project objectives in a clear and understandable way, reinforce my SQL weaknesses and document the project as well as my learning process.
